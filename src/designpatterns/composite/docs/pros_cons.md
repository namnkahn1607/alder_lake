### Advantages
🛴 **Convenient Recursion**. You can now work more confidently with deeply nested object structure, by using polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.
🧩 **Open/Closed Principle**. Introduce new element type without breaking the existing ones, which now works with the object Tree.

### Drawbacks
😵‍💫 **Difficult to generalize**. Things might get really difficult to provide a common Interface for classes that differ too much in functionality. You might solve this by adding more layer of abstraction, but that come with a trade-offs in increasing code complexity and decreasing comprehendability.
