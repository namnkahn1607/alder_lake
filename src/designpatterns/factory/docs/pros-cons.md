# Factory
### Advantages
1️⃣ **Single Responsibility Principle**. Seperate the Product creation code into the subclasses, making it easier to maintain.
🧩 **Open/Closed Principle**. Be able to introduce new Product without breaking the existing ones.
🤯 **Loose Coupling**. Avoid tight coupling between Factory and the Concrete Product.

### Drawbacks
🧠 **Code Complexity**. Increase overall code complexity by adding layer(s) of abstraction.
