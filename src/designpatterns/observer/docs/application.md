### Applicability
🔔 **Use the _Observer_ pattern when changes to one state require changing a large portion of other objects. And the actual set of changing objects is dynamic.**

👀 **The pattern also comes in handy in case some objects must follow other in order to behave, or for a specific case or limited time.**
