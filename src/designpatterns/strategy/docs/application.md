### Applicability
🍁 **As an alternative to a massive bloat of conditional statements that switch between variants of an algorithm.**

☄️ The original object delegates the execution to that _Strategy_ of the same Interface, instead of reimplementing whenever the urge to use rises.

🎲 **You have different variation of an algorithms and be able to switch interchangeably between them at runtime.**

🧨 _Strategy_ pattern let you alter behavior at runtime by associating with different sub-objects perform specific sub-tasks in distinct way.

💞 **A lot of similar classes that only differs in the way they execute some behavior.**

💡 Use _Strategy_ for that distinct behavior, combine the classes into one.
