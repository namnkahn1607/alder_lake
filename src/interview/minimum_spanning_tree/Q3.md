## 💻 Algorithm: Minimum Weight Feedback Edge Set

### ⚡ Insights
__Complementary Sets__: The set of edges in a graph can be partitioned into two sets: the Spanning Forest (acyclic) and the Feedback Edge Set (cycle-completing edges).

__The Inversion__: $W_{total} = W_{tree} + W_{feedback}$. To minimize $W_{feedback}$, we must maximize $W_{tree}$.

__Reduction__: The problem is equivalent to finding the Maximum Spanning Tree (MaxST).

### 🏁 Steps
__Modify Kruskal's__: Sort all edges in descending order (or use a Max-Priority Queue).

__Build MaxST__: Iterate through the sorted edges. Add an edge if it does not create a cycle (using Union-Find).

__Identify Feedback Set__: Any edge that would create a cycle (and is thus skipped by Kruskal's) belongs to the Minimum Weight Feedback Edge Set.

__Result__: Return the skipped edges (or their total weight, depending on the specific output requirement).

### 🧠 Complexity Analysis
__Time__: $O(E \log E)$ Sorting edges dominates.

__Space__: $O(V + E)$ Storing edges and Union-Find structure.
